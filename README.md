## JavaScript Functionality

This script handles the dynamic behavior of the Student Registration System web application:

* Add Students: Captures student information from the form and appends it to the table.
* Edit & Delete: Allows editing or deleting individual student entries. Edits automatically remove the old row before updating.
* Local Storage: Saves all student data in the browserâ€™s localStorage to persist across page reloads.
* Dynamic Scroll: The student list section automatically enables a vertical scrollbar when the number of entries exceeds a limit (11 rows on large screens, 5 rows on small screens).
* Responsive: Adjusts the scrollable height dynamically when the window is resized.

This JS ensures the interface remains user-friendly, responsive, and maintains data even after refreshing the page.
